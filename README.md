# FoxWeb-FullTextSearch
The FoxWeb Full-Text Search Engine is a VFP class that can be used to facilitate fast and efficient full-text searches in FoxPro tables. In order to support this functionality, the class creates an index, mapping each word contained in one or more field(s) in the source table. The fields being indexed may contain either plain text, or HTML data. In the case of HTML data, all HTML tags are removed before indexing the remaining text. This class was developed to provide full-text search capabilities for the FoxWeb Forum, but is now provided for free to the FoxPro community.
